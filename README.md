## Introduction

System design is a crucial skill for software engineers, particularly when building large-scale and complex applications. This repository aims to provide a collection of system design questions, solutions, and resources that will help you practice and improve your system design abilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone git@github.com:mwithington/system-design-prompts.git```

2. **Choose a problem**: Browse the repository to find a system design question that interests you. Each question is located in its own folder, containing a problem statement and any accompanying resources.

3. **Solve the problem**: Develop your own solution to the system design problem. You can use any programming language or technology stack of your choice. Feel free to explore different approaches and discuss your ideas with the community.

4. **Contribute**: Once you've solved a problem, contribute your solution by creating a new branch and submitting a pull request. Follow the guidelines outlined in the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

5. **Explore and learn**: Engage with the community! Review and discuss other engineers' solutions, provide feedback, and learn from their approaches. This repository aims to foster a collaborative environment where everyone can grow together.

## Repository Structure

```
The repository is structured as follows:
├── problem-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── resources/
├── problem-2/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── resources/
├── ...
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

- Each problem is contained within its own folder, named `problem-1`, `problem-2`, and so on.
- Inside each problem folder, you'll find a `README.md` file containing the description of the system design question.
- Additional resources related to the problem, such as diagrams or research papers, may be included within the `resources/` subdirectory.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged! To contribute your solution to a system design problem, please follow these guidelines:
